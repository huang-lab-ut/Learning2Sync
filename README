DATA FORMAT:
For space and legacy issues, this folder do not contain any dataset.

We demonstrate our data format using a few examples: 

An example file hierarchy we use to store processed depth images of each dataset looks like
  "processed_dataset/scannet/scene0000_01/0.mat", which corresponds to 
    the 1st scan for scene id "scene0000_01" of "scannet" dataset.
  each mat file contains attributes ['vertex', 'validIdx_rowmajor', 'pose']. 
  We will introduce each attribute as follows:
  
  
    

RELATIVE POSE ESTIMATION:
1. The source code of relative pose estimation is stored in "src/relative_pose_estimation"
 We use Fast Global Registration and Super4PCS to
    obtain pairwise relative pose estimation.

2. By default, results will be stored in "relative_pose".


CLASSIFICATION:
1. We first generate images for each estimated pairwise relative pose, the code is stored in "src/generate_images"
2. We then train our classifiers using the generated images, the code is stored in "src/training_classifiers"
3. The results will be stored in "classification/".


Optimizing Parameters of Weighting Module:
1. Given a trained classifier, we collect features for each estimated pairwise relative pose.
2.
